# Program provides the option to either check your current password 
# or to generate a new one of varied length and complexity
#
# There are two basic functions:
# check_password: which checks the users input (password) and displays information about it
# gen_password: generates a password of the length entered and includes Alphanumeric and Special character complexity
#
# The last block (while block) is a loop that runs to either check or generate a password and exits the program otherwise


# import random module to be able to obtain a random selection of characters
import random
