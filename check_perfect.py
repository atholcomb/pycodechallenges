# Create a function that tests whether or not an integer is a perfect number. 
# A perfect number is a number that can be written as the sum of its factors, excluding the number itself.
# For example, 6 is a perfect number, since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, where 1, 2, and 3 are all factors of 6. 
# Similarly, 28 is a perfect number, since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.

def check_perfect(number):
    factors = []
    sum_factors = 0

    
    # obtain the factors and store them into factors list
    for n in range(1, number):
        if number % n == 0:
            factors.append(n)

    # sum the digits of the original number to see if it's perfect
    for f in factors:
        sum_factors += f

        if sum_factors == number:
            return True
    return False
