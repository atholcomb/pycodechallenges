# Write a function that will return the longest word in a sentence. 
# In cases where more than one word is found, return the first one.
# Special characters and symbols don't count as part of the word.
# Return the longest word found in lowercase letters.
# A recursive version of this challenge can be found in here.

  # compare the length of the each word to the max length of the count list
  # return the longest string
  for w in words:
